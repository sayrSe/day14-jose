IPM (Iteration Planning Meeting):
	- IPM is a key event in Agile methodologies like Scrum.
	- It's a meeting where the development team, Product Owner, and sometimes other stakeholders gather.
	- The team discusses and estimates user stories or tasks from the backlog for a specific timeframe, often called a sprint or iteration.
	- The goal is to plan what work the team will commit to completing during that time, based on their capacity and the priority of the tasks.
	- It ensures that everyone understands what needs to be done and commits to delivering those tasks by the end of the iteration.

Kick Off (Development Kick Off with BA & QA):
	- A development kick-off is a project initiation meeting, typically involving developers, Business Analysts (BA), and Quality Assurance (QA) professionals.
	- Its purpose is to align the team before starting a software development project.
	- During the kick-off, the team discusses the project's objectives, scope, and business requirements.
	- Developers often share insights on the technical approach and architecture.
	- QA professionals may outline their testing strategy.
	- It's an opportunity to define roles and responsibilities, clarify doubts, and establish a common understanding of the project's goals and timeline.
	- This ensures that the entire team is on the same page before diving into development work.

Desk Check (Development Desk Check with BA & QA):
	- A desk check is an informal review meeting that occurs during the development process.
	- It involves developers, Business Analysts (BA), and Quality Assurance (QA) members.
	- Developers present their work or code to BA and QA for feedback and clarification.
	- BA can ensure that the work aligns with business requirements.
	- QA can verify that the code is on the right track for testing.
	- Any issues or questions are addressed promptly, helping to catch and resolve problems early.
	- This promotes collaboration and ensures that the work aligns with project objectives and requirements before more formal reviews or testing stages.
